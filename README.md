![Alt text](https://github.com/yash-chavhan/AMC-Mining-Data/blob/main/ey-workman-and-backhoe-silhouetted-against-sunrise-top-10-business-risks-opportunities-hero-14h07959_rf.jpg)
- This is a dataset of health and safety incidents in the mining industry. Mining operations face various health and safety risks, and accurately classifying incidents is crucial for identifying potential hazards, assessing risks, and implementing preventive measures. The Objective is to build a model capable of accurately classifying incidents based on the analysis and insights generated.
- The accidents are classified into 11 categories as follows:
  - HANDLING OF MATERIALS
  - FIRE/EXPLOSION
  - EXPLODING VESSELS UNDER PRESSURE
  - ELECTRICAL
  - ENTRAPMENT
  - EXPLOSIVES AND BREAKING AGENTS
  - HAULAGE
  - INUNDATION
  - SLIP OR FALL OF PERSON
  - OTHERS
  - TOXIC


- Some of the major insights generated were as follows:
  - The incident which caused fatality were obtained as 186 over the years from 2000 to 2023. And the most no. of death 73 were observed during "HAULAGE".
  - The incident which caused permanent injuries were obtained as 367 over the years from 2000 to 2023. And 299 injuries were caused during "HANDLING OF MATERIALS" which highest among other.
  - There were almost 25% of the incidents which involved worker which have less than 6 months of experience carring out the job.

- The score attained by the trained models were as follows:
  - Linear regresion provided a score of 0.22462490486421272.
  - Decision tree with a score of 0.5073841494627485.
  - Random forest with a score of 0.7731067914039915.
  - XGboost provided a score of 0.8070864092468012.
